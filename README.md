Look at your Housie ticket. In the first column you will see numbers from 1 to 9, in the second the numbers 10 to 19 appear, the third contains 20 to 29. This pattern continues until the final column (the eighth) which contains the numbers 80 to 90.

Listen to the caller. She will call out numbers. When you have those numbers, mark them with a highlighter, bingo marker or similar instrument.

Make a row. If the numbers called fill a row on your Housie card, you can win if you are the first to call out.

Signify your win by calling out “Housie!” or “Whooo!”

Strategize. If you are feeling lucky, bet more on your Housie ticket to win bigger, or wait to see if you can fill more than one row before someone else does.

Play by the rules. Don’t criticize the game strategy of your opponents, and don’t try to distract them. Most of all, make sure you pay attention and really have a win before you call out Housie!
